# ObjectivePaths
ObjectivePaths is a small Julia library aiming to make a few operations around handling paths to folders and files easier. It's a small wrapper around Base's [file system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/file/) applying some ideas from Python's [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) library, in a Julian way.


Installation:
```Julia
] add ObjectivePaths
```
